      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding Mental Health</h3>
      <p class="mb-8">
        Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social
        well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and plays a crucial
        role in our ability to cope with stress, relate to others, and make
        choices. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and
        taking care of our mental well-being is essential for leading a
        fulfilling life.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Common Mental Health Challenges</h3>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Breaking the Stigma</h3>

        about mental health. Everyone deserves support, understanding, and
        access to mental health resources.

          Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables for vitamins,
          minerals, and fiber.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include lean proteins such as poultry, fish, beans, tofu, and eggs for
          muscle growth and repair.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat

          Incorporate healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and
          olive oil for heart health.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Portion Control</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
        <li>Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes.</li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to serving sizes listed on food labels and measure out
          appropriate portions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid eating straight from the package, as it can lead to overeating.
        </li>
        <li>
          Listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues, and stop eating when
          you feel satisfied.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Hydration</h3>

        <li>
          Carry a reusable water bottle with you to stay hydrated on the go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drink water before, during, and after exercise to replenish fluids
          lost through sweat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Infuse water with fresh fruits, herbs, or cucumbers for added flavor
          and hydration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limit sugary drinks like soda, fruit juices, and energy drinks, as
          they can contribute to excess calories and sugar intake.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Mindful Eating</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
        <li>
          Eat slowly and savor each bite, paying attention to the taste,
          texture, and aroma of your food.
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimize distractions while eating, such as watching TV or scrolling
          on your phone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Listen to your body's hunger and fullness signals, and eat only when
          you're hungry.
        </li>
        <li>
